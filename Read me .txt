How to tuning PID parameters ?
    1. Tuning 'PROPORTIONAL' or 'Kp' First . Tuning it until translation stage move nearly closet to the reference image.
    2. Then tuning 'INTEGRAL' or 'Ki' for reduce error from 'PROPORTIONAL' or 'Kp'.
    3. Then tuning 'DERIVATIVE' or 'Kd' for reduce overshoot.

How it effect ?
'PROPORTIONAL' or 'Kp' effect to the current error ( setpoint - measured output of the system ).
'INTEGRAL' or 'Ki' effect to the contribution of the accumulated error over time to the control signal .
'DERIVATIVE' or 'Kd' effect to the stability and responsiveness of the control loop .
